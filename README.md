# Sage
Sage is a set of tools for Salesforce Marketing Cloud content development, analytics and security.

The goal of this project is to make writing, debugging and analyzing content easier.

At the moment, it only contains an ANTLR4 grammar without an interpreter.

Features on the roadmap include:
* Transpile the parsed tree into C#
* Generate a runtime capable of executing the C# code (aka - build ampscript functions)
* A 95% compatibility target for supporting ampscript functions, with mockability for local execution.
* Debugger ability to step through ampscript code
* Static code analysis tools to identify and remediate performance or security issues
