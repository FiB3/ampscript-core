Hello World 

I can declare variables
%%[ 
    VAR @foo 
]%% 

I can set their values and see them in the debugger
%%[
    SET @foo = 5
    SET @bar = "Biz"
]%%

I can loop through values and display them
%%[
    FOR @I = 1 TO 10 DO
]%%
    Hello
%%[
    NEXT @I
]%%

It's now a whole new world for conte    nt!
